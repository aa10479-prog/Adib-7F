    <h1><em>Why I support Arsenal FC</em></h1> 

    <!-- Section: Club History and Intro -->
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Arsenal Football Club is a historic English professional football club from North London, founded in 1886 by munitions workers, known as "The Gunners".</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Current Team Analysis -->
    <h1>THE BEST TEAM OF ALL TIME, ARSENAL FOOTBALL CLUB!</h1>
    
    <img src="arsenal.jpg" alt="Arsenal team photo" width="250">

    <p>Elite Defense: Arsenal boasts the league's best defensive record, with 11 clean sheets and just 0.6 goals conceded per match. The central defensive partnership of William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães, along with the goalkeeping of David Raya, forms a formidable backline. Set-Piece Mastery: The team is widely regarded as world-class at set pieces, a significant source of goals and a crucial Plan B against teams that sit in a low defensive block. This is a result of meticulous coaching from specialist Nicolas Jover and players' willingness to attack the ball. Tactical Flexibility: Arteta has developed a tactically fluid team capable of seamlessly transitioning between systems (e.g., 4-3-3, 3-2-5 in possession) to adapt to different opponents. They are comfortable in high pressing, mid-blocks, or low blocks, relying on player intelligence and discipline to maintain defensive solidity. Talented Youth & Star Players: The squad is one of the youngest in the Premier League and features key players like Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka, and Martin Ødegaard, all of whom are considered among the most valuable in the league. Winning Mentality: Recent performances, including a convincing 3-1 Champions League win at Inter Milan on January 20, 2026, demonstrate a growing maturity, intelligence, and a strong winning mentality needed to compete for major trophies.</p>
